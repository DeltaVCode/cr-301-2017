# Community Involvement

In this course we continue teaching you the technical skills that it takes to be a part of the web development world.
However, technical proficiency on its own won't make you a "great" programmer.
A large part of being a great programmer is being involved in your community.
As a junior developer, you become acquainted with some of the higher concepts and larger players in the local web dev community as well as in the global programming space.
As an intermediate developer, regular participation in things like meetups and conferences keep your name in circulation and keep your skills relevant as you learn about subjects outside of your job responsibilities.
As a senior developer, you get in touch with less-experienced developers in your field, nurturing the next generation of programmers.
Everyone wins when we get involved in the community, so we figure we should give you incentive to get out and join the fray.

## Community Slacks

Slack communities connect you with local/regional developers.
You can discuss various programming topics, and learn about job and learning opportunities.

## Iowa Code Camp

[Iowa Code Camp](http://iowacodecamp.com/) is a free semiannual event with presentations about a variety of topics.
Because there are several presentations in every time slot, this is a great opportunity to give a first technical presentation, which can help you learn a topic in depth and practice public speaking.
Many local employers sponsor the event and have booths where you can learn about job opportunities.

**The next Iowa Code Camp is July 22, 2017 in Coralville. Everyone should try to attend.**

## What's a Meetup?

Meetups take a couple of different flavors.
You've got your monthly-ish local area meetings, and you've got your more-regular programming nights.
At the monthly-ish meetings you'll see local programmers give short or long talks about whatever strikes their fancy.
You'll learn about new topics in the field, or get reinforced on some common problems that programmers face.
You'll even get fed and maybe a bit of booze to top it off.
Finally, and most importantly, it's your first real networking opportunity as a developer.
Concerned that you don't know enough or aren't skilled enough to "deserve" to be a part?
It's ok, meetups are oftentimes very welcoming to beginners!
It's a good time for most and entirely worth an evening or two.

The programming nights are as they sound: nights where folks get together after work and chisel away at some project.
Most people have things to work on, but that doesn't mean that they're not open for conversation or willing to give a little help!
Oftentimes the people that attend these programming nights go just so they can meet new developers and help them work through their programming problems.

## Where to Find/Which Ones to Attend?

[Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com) is a great site for finding a local meetup, and there's a group for most sides of programming.
Here are a few:

- [TechCorridor.io Meetup Aggregator](https://www.meetup.com/techcorridorio/) has a variety of meetups and hack nights.
- [IowaJS](https://www.meetup.com/iowajs/) focuses on JavaScript and related topics.
- [CRineta](https://www.meetup.com/CRIneta-Cedar-Rapids-NET-User-Group/) focuses on .NET, but often features talks about web technologies and other aspects of programming in general.
- [I-380 PASS](https://www.meetup.com/380PASS/) is the local chapter of [PASS](http://www.pass.org/), focused on Microsoft SQL Server and other data-related topics. This group also hosts an annual [SQL Saturday](http://sqlsaturday.com/) around June.
- [Iowa City Game Dev](https://www.meetup.com/Iowa-City-Game-Dev-Meetup/) focuses on video game development.
- [Eastern Iowa Agile](https://www.meetup.com/Eastern-Iowa-Agile/) focuses on non-code team dynamics, including product/project management.

## Submitting Your Assignment

Before the end of the course, you are to attend one meetup event at one of the above (or other related) meetup groups.
Take a screenshot of **your** RSVP to the event.
You are to include this screenshot as a file upload along with your report of the event, outlined below.

**If you went to a larger monthy meetup:** Submit in text the titles of the talks you heard and (at least) two people you met, where (if) they work, and what they do there. Write about what you found interesting (or uninteresting) about the subject matter of the talks, as well as anything else notable about the meetup.

**If you went to a programming/hack night:** Submit in text what you worked on, (at least) two people you met, where they work, and what they do there. If you had any interesting conversations or anyone provided you with some significant help, note that as well.
